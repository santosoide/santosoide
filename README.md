Hi there! I'm @santosoide with an interest in software engineering and leadership.

I have several years of experience in the tech industry, working on a variety of projects ranging from mobile apps to web platforms. I have a strong background in agile development methodologies and a track record of delivering high-quality software on time and on budget.

As an engineering manager, I am focused on building and leading high-performing teams. I am skilled at communicating with both technical and non-technical stakeholders, and I am always looking for ways to improve processes and drive efficiencies.

I am excited to connect with other professionals in the tech industry and explore new opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to chat or collaborate on a project.
